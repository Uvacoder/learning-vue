## Best Practices

- Why best practices are important?
  - What do we all want at the end of the day?
    - Faster development
    - Fewer bugs
    - More opportunities for learning
  - Instead of best practices, think of them as chosen conventions - instead.
- What makes a convention "good"?
  - There are two main factors that contribute to whether a convention is good or not:
    - They enable developers to write great code with a low barrier of entry
    - They are easy to refactor and/or abandon
- How to implement conventions
  - There are three main stages to implementing chosen conventions:
    - Selection
      - Define the problem
      - Things are rarely objective and absolute
      - Avoid bike-shedding
      - Time-constrained voting
      - Disagree and commit
      - 3 month discussion freezes
    - Implementation
      - Automate everything
        - Linters (i.e., eslint, stylelint, markdownlint)
        - Formatters (i.e., prettier)
        - Image Optimization (i.e., image-min)
        - Generators (i.e., hygen/plop)
        - Code Snippets (i..e, VS Code)
    - Maintenance
      - Build emotional safety and awareness
        - Don't blame individuals
        - Find systematic solutions
        - If you have power, protect your devs
      - The Jidoka principle
        - Discover an abnormality
        - Stop the process
        - Fix the immediate process
        - Investigate and solve the root cause
        - The Andon Cord
