# Introduction

Welcome to "Production-Grade Vue" hosted by Frontend Masters!

## What is this course about?

Building applications that can scale and grow is more than simply following a series of rules. In this workshop, you will learn proven patterns for building production Vue.js apps while gaining an understanding of why certain patterns exist. Equipped with this, you will feel more confident in choosing what is best for your application.

This course is unique to typical intermediate to advanced Vue.js courses because this course is not merely a list of tools and techniques to memorize, but it is designed to familiarize you with key concepts and ideas that go into creating production level Vue.js applications. As we know with most technology, techniques come and go and are useful in certain contexts while harmful in others, that is why the ideas taught in this course are key to building production Vue.js applications.

## Why did I create this course?

The reason I created this course because while there are a lot of different ways to solve the same problem in Vue.js, there a lot of best practices, patterns and ideas that a lot of people would benefit from knowing so that they can create the best apps possible they can.

And of course, a big thank you goes out to Frontend Masters for making this course a reality.
