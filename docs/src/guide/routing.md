## Routing

- Three main categories of routing
  - View Components - Definition for page level components (i.e., Home, About, Dashboard)
  - Layout Components - Markup shared between pages (i.e., header, sidebar, etc.)
  - Routes - Define how paths map to view components
- Add dynamic key to route-view components
- vue-meta
- Lazy load routes
